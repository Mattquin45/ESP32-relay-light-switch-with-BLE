# Autimator

Developed a smart light switch automation system using C++ on an ESP32, incorporating Boolean logic to enable automated control. Implemented Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and relay-based circuitry for reliable wireless operation over household power systems. Optimized BLE signal processing to improve system responsiveness and reduce control latency.
